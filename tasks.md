## Tasks
The following tasks have been completed or are planned for the project:

- **Pipelines**: Implemented pipelines for the auto-generation of `requirements.txt`, Sphinx documentation, and code formatting of Python files. These pipelines are triggered on push to the master branch, ensuring consistent documentation and code quality. Additionally, there is a pipeline for checking code formatting on pull requests to the master branch, promoting clean and readable code.

- **Data Handling**: Developed functions for automatically downloading, extracting, and loading data into memory. This ensures a streamlined and automated data preprocessing process, enabling efficient analysis.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted basic EDA to gain insights into the airline performance data. Explored various aspects, such as 
    1. flight durations
    2. departure and arrival delays
    3. fleet sizes
    4. cancellation causes
    5. flight trends over time
    6. popular routes
    7. delay patterns across months
    8. flight count distribution
    9. carrier performance
    10. popular airports and aircraft models.

- **Charts and Visualizations**: Created charts and visualizations to answer specific questions and provide a visual representation of the data. Some of the visualizations include 
    1. Total Planned Flight Time for each Carrier
    2. Maximum Departure and Arrival Delay for each Carrier
    3. Number of Aircrafts in the fleet of each Carrier
    4. Cancellation Causes
    5. Planned Flights over Time
    6. Most popular routes
    7. Total Delay Time for Each Month
    8. Number of flights over hours
    9. Flights Count for each Carrier
    10. 10 most popular Airports
    11. Cancellation Rate for each Carrier
    12. Airports and their popularity
    13. Delay Coefficient for Each Month
    14. 10 most popular aircraft models
    15. the plane model associated with the most delays
    16. the best and worst times to fly to minimize delays, and a heatmap showing the relationship between flight distance and delays/cancellations

## In Progress
There are currently no tasks in progress.

## Ideas
The following ideas are being considered for further analysis:

- **Trends and Patterns**: Investigate trends and patterns of flight delays and cancellations over time, across different carriers, airports, and routes. Identify any significant patterns or recurring issues that can help improve overall airline performance.

- **Airline Schedule Padding**: Analyze the impact of airline schedule padding on consumer choice behavior. Explore how passengers' preferences are influenced by the buffer time allocated between flights and examine its effect on customer satisfaction.

- **Weather Impact**: Study the relationship between weather conditions and flight delays and cancellations. Analyze how various weather factors, such as storms, fog, or extreme temperatures, affect airline operations and passenger travel experience.

- **State-wise Delay Analysis**: Identify states or regions that experience the highest frequency or longest duration of flight delays. Analyze the contributing factors, such as air traffic congestion, airport infrastructure, or weather patterns, to understand the variations in delay occurrence across different locations.

These ideas will further enhance the understanding of the airline performance data and provide valuable insights for optimizing operations and improving the overall travel experience.
