# Airline Performance Data Analysis

This project focuses on performing data analysis on structured airline performance data. It is conducted as part of the Data Science Studies in the 2nd semester at Warsaw University of Technology.

## Objectives
The primary objective of this project is to explore and analyze the provided airline performance data. The project is implemented in groups of three, allowing for collaboration and knowledge sharing among team members. While no strict tasks are assigned, the aim is to uncover insightful patterns, trends, and relationships within the data.

## Tasks
A comprehensive list of completed and planned work can be found in the tasks.md file. The tasks outline the steps taken by the team to preprocess, analyze, and visualize the structured data effectively. Each team member contributes to different aspects of the project, enabling a well-rounded analysis.

## Technologies and Tools Used
The project utilizes a range of technologies and tools to facilitate the data analysis process. These include:

- Python: Python serves as the primary programming language for the project. Various Python libraries, such as selenium, pandas, geopandas, seaborn, matplotlib, and numpy, are employed for data manipulation, analysis, visualization, and geospatial processing.

- Sphinx: Sphinx is employed for auto-documentation of the Python code. Following the docstring markup guidelines, Sphinx generates comprehensive documentation that explains the code's functionality, making it easier for team members and other stakeholders to understand and navigate the project.

- CI/CD Pipelines: Continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) pipelines are established to maintain a clean codebase. The pipelines automate tasks such as code formatting using the black formatter, ensuring consistent coding style across the project. Additionally, the pipelines facilitate the deployment of the Sphinx documentation, making it readily accessible for reference.

The combination of these technologies and tools empowers the team to analyze the airline performance data efficiently, document the project effectively, and streamline the development process.
